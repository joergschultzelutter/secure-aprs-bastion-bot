# Return Codes
`secure-aprs-bastion-bot` was deliberately designed so that no output from the called programs is sent back to the requester. If necessary, such a return transmission can be implemented individually via the `--command-script` using either the supplied `send-aprs-message.py` script or other options such as [Apprise](https://www.github.com/caronc/apprise). The following return values are supported and will be sent as an APRS message response to the user:

The return codes, such as `200 ok`, are sent as APRS responses to the original user. This procedure allows a very short APRS message to be sent as confirmation that the requested command sequence has either already been completed or will be started as a separate process immediately after the APRS response is sent.

| Return value       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `200 ok`           | The user's call sign and `--command-code` were found in the configuration file. The TOTP code was valid. The `--command-string` was executed. The `--command-string` script was waited for until it finished executing.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `202 accepted`     | The user's call sign and `--command-code` were found in the configuration file. The TOTP code was valid. The `--command-string` was started as a separate process because the user configuration included the [`--detached-launch`](/docs/configure.md#parameters) flag. No wait was performed for the `--command-string` script to finish.                                                                  |
| `403 forbidden`    | This is the program's default return code. Possible causes of errors include: the call sign and/or `--command-code` are not present in the configuration file. The transmitted TOTP code is invalid. The transmitted TOTP code has already been used.                                                                                                                                                        |
| `510 not extended` | The identified `--command-string` still contains placeholders after `core-aprs-client` [replaced the placeholders with the user's additional parameters](/README.md#anatomy-of-an-aprs-message-to-secure-aprs-bastion-bot). Usually, this means that you created a user script with placeholders - but the APRS user did submit an insufficient/lower number of additional parameters to `core-aprs-client`. | 

> [!TIP]
> If you receive a `510 not extended` error, check the number of user-submittable parameter placeholders in your  `--command-string` (`$1`..`$9`) against the number of parameters in your APRS message (see [message anatomy documentation](/docs/message-anatomy.md)); the latter must be at least equal to the number of user-transmittable parameter placeholders in your user script. If you transmit _more_ user parameters in your APRS message than are available in your `--command-string`, no error will be triggered; these additional parameters will simply be ignored.
